## Development Stack

The CASS Library is a Javascript Library, and is available in [GitHub](https://github.com/cassproject/cass-npm), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cassproject) and [Bower](https://bower.io/search/?q=cassproject).

The preferred development environment is not specified, but we tend to use Visual Studio Code.

## Governance

* The CaSS Project is an open source community governed by [Eduworks Corporation](https://www.eduworks.com) ("Eduworks").
* The CaSS website, documentation, and GitHub project are managed by Eduworks.
* The CaSS Project accepts contributions in the form of pull requests, communications, suggestions, documents, and issues via GitHub.
* All contributors must sign a CaSS Project CLA prior to making any contribution outside of GitHub. The CaSS Project CLAs are similar to the Individual and Corporate Apache Contributor License Agreements. Please email [us](mailto:cass@eduworks.com) for a CLA.

## Architecture

The CaSS Architecture Slides document, available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P5SR93EPrxjbTRKfz70tmBXmmsH0JjxKvoZR-70UDsg), is a useful set of visualizations for understanding CaSS and its architecture.
