## CaSS Schema

A 'schema' describes the organization/structure of a set of data.

The schema for CaSS objects is documented [here](http://schema.cassproject.org/), listing the data associated with each CaSS object. CaSS is built upon the pre-existing work done at [Schema.org](https://schema.org/)

## Sandbox

The sandbox is a public site hosting a CaSS instance where you may try CaSS without setting up a CaSS instance yourself, along with a CaSS Editor for easy viewing and editting. There are two sandboxes:

* [Latest stable version](https://sandbox.cassproject.org/)
* [Latest unstable version](https://dev.cassproject.org/)
