# Taxonomy Management 

Note: In Credential Engine instances of CAT, taxonomies are referred to
as concept schemes.

Taxonomies can be used to categorize and label competencies in
frameworks. The Taxonomies page can be visited by clicking on the
Taxonomies icon on the left side bar highlighted by the red box in the
image below.

![CAT Taxonomy Management - Taxonomies Icon](/docs/taxonomies-icon.png)

On this page, taxonomies are shown with their names in bold. Beneath the
name, you can see when it was created and last modified. If you have
permission to edit the taxonomy, it will say “Editable”.

## Sorting and Filtering Taxonomies  
 
You can sort and filter the list of taxonomies by clicking the filter
button next to the search bar. The button next to it clears any filters
you’ve applied.

![CAT Taxonomy Management - Filter Button](/docs/taxonomies-filter-button.png)

The filter button will open up a side panel to the right of the taxonomy
list with options to sort and filter the list.

## Creating New Taxonomies 
 
A new taxonomy can be created within CaSS Authoring Tools by pressing
the “Create New” button at the top of the taxonomy management page.

![CAT Taxonomy Management - Create New Taxonomy](/docs/taxonomies-create-new.png)

When you click on the “Create New” button to create a new taxonomy, you
will be required to enter a Taxonomy Name to your new taxonomy.
Additional properties can be added by clicking the “add property”
button.

## Adding Concepts to Taxonomies  
To add concepts to your taxonomy, click the “add concept” button below
the taxonomy details.

![CAT Taxonomy Management - Add Concepts](/docs/taxonomies-add-concepts.png)

You can construct a hierarchy of concepts by checking the box to the
left of a concept. The “add concept” button text will change to “add
child”, which you can click to place a concept underneath the one you’ve
checked.

## Editing Taxonomies and Concepts  

To edit a single concept or taxonomy, hover over the item you want to
edit and an edit icon will appear. Click the icon highlighted in red in
the image below.

![CAT Taxonomy Management - Edit](/docs/taxonomies-edit.png)

A modal will appear and you can edit the taxonomy or concept’s
properties. This modal also allows you to delete the concept or taxonomy
and export the object. Click “done” when you’ve finished making changes.

![CAT Taxonomy Management - Edit Modal](/docs/taxonomies-edit-modal.png)

You can add new properties to your object from here too by clicking the
“add property” button at the bottom of the modal. You’ll see a list of
properties that are available to add. Select the property you’d like to
add, enter in the value, and click “save property”.

![CAT Taxonomy Management - Add a Property](/docs/taxonomies-add-property.png)

If there’s a property you’d like to add to multiple concepts, use the
checkboxes to select the concepts you want to edit and click “edit
multiple”.

![CAT Taxonomy Management - Edit Multiple Concepts](/docs/taxonomies-edit-multiple.png)

You’ll see a list of properties that are available to add. Select the
property you’d like to add, enter in the value, and click “apply to
multiple”.

If you make a mistake while editing, click the undo button in the bar at
the top of the page to revert your most recent changes.

### Changing Concept Hierarchy 

There are several ways to move concepts around in the hierarchy. You can
drag and drop the concept to the spot you’d like to move it to by
hovering over the concept. The icon highlighted in the image below will
appear and you can click on it, hold down, and drag the concept to the
appropriate position.

![CAT Taxonomy Management - Drag and Drop](/docs/taxonomies-drag-and-drop.png)

You can also move a concept by selecting its checkbox. Click the cut or
copy icon highlighted in red in the image below, select another concept,
and click the paste icon.

![CAT Taxonomy Management - Cut, Copy, Paste](/docs/taxonomies-cut-copy-paste.png)

With one concept selected, you can move it with keyboard commands as
well. You can cut, copy and paste, or use the arrow keys to move it to
the position you want.

- Tab - Switch focus between elements on the page
- Space - Select the element currently in focus
- Shift + X - Cut competency
- Shift + C - Cut and copy competency
- Shift + V - Drop competency
- Shift + ↑ & Shift + ↓ - Move concept up and down in the list.
- Shift + ← & Shift + → - Move concept indent and outdent in the list

## Managing Users and Sharing a Taxonomy  
 
To control who can view and edit a taxonomy you own, click the “manage
users” button highlighted in red in the image below.

![CAT Taxonomy Management - Manage Users Button](/docs/taxonomies-users-button.png)

You can see who the admins and viewers of your taxonomy are, and add or
remove users and organizations. This view also has a shareable link to
your taxonomy that you can copy to your clipboard and give to someone
else.

![CAT Taxonomy Management - Share Taxonomy and Manage Users](/docs/taxonomies-manage-users.png)

## Viewing Taxonomies and Concepts in More Detail 
 
By default, only primary properties are shown on a taxonomy and
concepts. To see some additional properties, click “secondary” in the
panel at the top of the screen. This will show all primary and secondary
properties that have values. To see all properties that have values,
click on “tertiary”.

## Exporting a Taxonomy 

Once you’ve created or imported a new taxonomy, exporting the taxonomy
is a relatively simple process. Users must first view their taxonomies
through the taxonomy tab in the CaSS Authoring Tool and select the
desired taxonomy to be exported. Once the taxonomy is selected, users
can select the export button at the top of the screen and will be
prompted to choose their desired file format to export that taxonomy.

![CAT Taxonomy Management - Export Button](/docs/exporting-frameworks.png)

Users will be prompted with the window displayed below and can select
their desired file format from the options provided in the dropdown
menu.

![CAT Taxonomy Management - Export Oprtions](/docs/select-option-export.png)  
 
Once the desired format is selected users can select the “export file”
button at the bottom right corner of the window and the taxonomy will be
downloaded to your computer or opened in a new tab of your browser.

## Importing a Taxonomy

The process of Importing a new taxonomy is also relatively simple. From
the taxonomy tab on the sidebar, users have the ability to view all
existing taxonomies within the system. At the top of the page is a list
of options which allow users to import and create new taxonomies into
the database of existing taxonomies.

![CAT Taxonomy Management - Import Button ](/docs/taxonomy-import-button.png)

After clicking the import taxonomy button users will be prompted with a
new page where they have the ability to select the source of the
taxonomy they are trying to import. Users have the ability to upload csv
and json files. Examples and templates are linked from the panel on the
right side of the screen. Users can drag the taxonomy into the dotted
window displayed below.

![CAT Taxonomy Management - Import Page](/docs/taxonomy-import-page.png)

Once imported users can select the process files button and the desired
taxonomy will be imported into the your CaSS Authoring Tool database.
