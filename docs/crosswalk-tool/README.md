# Framework Crosswalk Tool 
 
The Framework Crosswalk Tool can be used to create relationships across
two separate frameworks.

Note: In order to apply any relationships created with the crosswalk
tool, at least one of the frameworks initially selected in the tool
wizard must be owned and editable by the logged in user.

## Accessing the Framework Crosswalk Tool 

The Framework Crosswalk Tool can be accessed at any time by selecting
the crosswalk frameworks icon under the competencies &
frameworks category in the navigation menu.

## Crosswalk Overview  

Framework crosswalking is comprised of four steps:

1. Select Source
    - Selection of the source framework
    - The selection for the source framework is limited to frameworks that
    are owned and editable by the current user.
    - The source framework also defines the relationship types available
    for the crosswalk by determining the applied configuration of that
    framework.  If there is no explicit configuration applied to the
    selected framework, the relationships available for the crosswalk
    are determined by the selected browser default configuration or the
    instance default configuration.
3.  Select Target
    - Selection of the target framework
3.  Align Frameworks
    - Creation of the relationships between the
    competencies of the two frameworks
4.  Save & Review
    - Review of created relationships, determination of
    where the relationships will reside (one or both of the chosen
    frameworks), and the saving of the relationships

The current step will be highlighted by the progress bar at the top of
the crosswalk tool screen.

## Aligning Framework Competencies 

After selecting the source and target frameworks, the selected
frameworks will be displayed in side by side panes.  Any existing
relationships between the two frameworks will be indicated by orange
bubbles underneath the corresponding competency in the source framework
pane.

![CAT Crosswalk Frameworks - Main Alignment Screen](/docs/main-alignment-screen.png)

At the top of each framework pane are four action buttons.  Clicking
these action buttons will affect only the framework view in the
corresponding pane.

- show aligned only - show only competencies that have alignments to competencies in the other framework
- show unaligned only - show only competencies that do not have alignments to competencies in the other framework
- show all (default) - show all competencies regardless of existing alignments
- change framework - change the source/target framework
- Selecting this action will remove all unsaved alignments from the current crosswalk session\

### Adding a Crosswalk Relationship/Alignment 

To begin adding a relationship between the competencies within the
frameworks, hover over the appropriate competency in the source
framework pane and click the add button.

![CAT Crosswalk Frameworks - Relationship Add Button](/docs/relationship-add-button.png)

Select the desired relationship type from the dropdown.

![CAT Crosswalk Frameworks - Relationship Type Selection](/docs/relationship-type-selection.png)

Once a relationship type has been selected, click the + button to the
right of each competency in the target framework pane you wish to apply
the relationship.  When clicked, the + button will transition into a
checkmark.  Clicking on this checkmark will remove the relationship.

![CAT Crosswalk Frameworks - Target Competency Selection](/docs/target-competency-selection.png)

After selecting the desired competencies, click the apply
alignments button.  Once applied, you will notice a running tally of
added and removed alignments under the crosswalk progress bar.  

![CAT Crosswalk Frameworks - Apply Alignments Button.](/docs/apply-alignments-button.png)

![CAT Crosswalk Frameworks - Alignment Change Tally](/docs/alignment-change-tally.png)

The alignment tally will keep track of both the addition of new
alignments and the removal of alignments created in previous crosswalk
sessions.  

Once applied, alignments can be quickly accessed by clicking on the
corresponding alignment bubble underneath the source competency.

### Removing a Crosswalk Relationship/Alignment 

To remove an existing relationship click on the corresponding alignment
bubble underneath the source competency.

![CAT Crosswalk Frameworks - Alignment Bubble](/docs/alignment-bubble.png)

In the target pane, click on the checkmark icon to the right of the
competency you wish to remove from the relationship.  When clicked, the
checkmark icon will transition into a + button.  

![CAT Crosswalk Frameworks - Target Competency Removal](/docs/target-competency-removal.png)

After removing the undesired competencies, click the apply
alignments button.  Once applied, you will notice a running tally of
added and removed alignments under the crosswalk progress bar.

## Crosswalk Review and Save 

To save all changes made during the crosswalk session to the repository,
click on the save & review button.

![CAT Crosswalk Frameworks - Save & Review](/docs/alignment-save-and-review.png)

The summary screen will be displayed detailing the overall alignment
changes between the two frameworks and the framework application
selector.  By default, all owned or editable frameworks used in the
crosswalk will be checked.  A check mark next the framework means all
alignment/relationship changes made will be applied to that framework.

Note:  You may only apply alignment changes to frameworks that you own
or can edit.

If you wish to make further changes to the alignments, click on the
continue editing button.

![CAT Crosswalk Frameworks - Continue Editing Button](/docs/continue-editing.png)

When you are satisfied with your changes, click on the save alignments
button.
