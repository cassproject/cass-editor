third-party applications query CaSS to determine competencies held by an entity</li> <li>How CaSS responds to such queries</li> <li>How CaSS can be used as a more traditional “profile manager.”</li> <li>How CaSS implements the ADL Total Learning Architecture “profile API.”</li></ul> <p>This page describes the procedure CaSS currently uses to answer a query about a person’s competency and the

The form of the query is “Does subject hold competency C?”</p> <ul><li>The subject is the person whose competence is being queried</li> <li>The competency C being queried is called the root competency</li></ul> <p>This page only describes the algorithms, and does not address security, privacy, or the interaction of the assertion processing and query/response mechanisms with external systems.</p> <h2 id="requirements"><a href="#requirements" class="header-anchor">#</a> Requirements</h2> <p>CaSS is designed to collect and provide information about a learner’s or employee’s competencies and skills to systems used in education, training, talent management, and workforce development. The simplest way to conceptualize the role of CaSS is as a “profile service” that collects, maintains, and publishes a list of the competencies that a learner or employee or job applicant has mastered (Figure 1). CaSS can operate in this mode, but this conceptualization fails to recognize the many real-world complexities and requirements surrounding the collection and determination of competencies. This section briefly discusses these as informative background.</p> <p><img src="/docs/assets/img/centralized-competency-profile.7c3bc92c.png" alt="Image"></p> <h3 id="competency-articulation-via-relations"><a href="#competency-articulation-via-relations" class="header-anchor">#</a> Competency Articulation via Relations</h3> <p>The first (and most obvious) requirement for sharing competency records among multiple systems is that they reference the same competencies or, barring that, have the ability to articulate different sets of competencies that address related skills, knowledge, and ability. The CaSS framework and competency services enable systems to reference common sets of competencies and enables relations to be defined among different competencies. However, it is impractical to expect that the systems using CaSS will be always be aware of the frameworks referenced by other such systems and, even if they are aware, that they will be able to use the relations in computations. It is therefore a requirement that CaSS be able to apply relations among competencies to competency data.</p> <h3 id="granularity-and-roll-up-rules"><a href="#granularity-and-roll-up-rules" class="header-anchor">#</a> Granularity and Roll-up Rules</h3> <p>The second requirement for sharing competency records stems from use cases in which the competency frameworks used by one system are at a completely different level of granularity than those used by another system. For example, intelligent tutoring systems such as <a href="https://www.carnegielearning.com/learning-solutions/software/cognitive-tutor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carnegie Learning’s cognitive tutors<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a> track highly granular “knowledge components,” competency-enabled learning management systems such as <a href="https://download.moodle.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moodle 3.1<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a> assign competencies to activities and assessments, and systems used for staffing and career management are generally concerned with much less granular job and workforce skills. For a network such as that idealized in Figure 1 on the previous page to make sense, an intelligent tutoring system must be able to report data at the level of knowledge components while an applicant tracking system (ATS) consumes them at the level of job skills. The CaSS framework and competency services have the ability to store “roll-up rules” and relations that can be used to determine how knowledge about mastery of more granular competencies can be used as evidence of mastery of less granular competencies, but it is again unreasonable to expect that the ATS will know about the relevant relations and roll-up rules, much less know how to compute with them. Moreover, even if every collaborating system did retrieve and perform such computations, it is unlikely that they would do so in a consistent manner. It is therefore a requirement that CaSS be able to apply relations and roll-up rules to compute the state of a competency from the reported state of other related competencies, and that it do so in a documented, consistent, and potentially configurable manner.</p> <h3 id="confidence-evidence-and-validity"><a href="#confidence-evidence-and-validity" class="header-anchor">#</a> Confidence, Evidence, and Validity</h3> <p>The third requirement for sharing competency records comes from use cases in which:</p> <ul><li>Multiple systems report data about an individual’s competency, which could be conflicting</li> <li>Users have a desire to know how much they can trust data in an individual’s profile</li> <li>Users want to examine evidence of competency, not just statements about competency</li> <li>Data is time limited, as often occurs with certifications or qualifications</li></ul> <p>All of these scenarios commonly arise in discussions about competencies with designers of education and training systems and proponents of competency-based approaches. It is therefore a requirement that CaSS be able to collect and report evidence, time limitations, and information on the confidence of an assertion about a learner’s competency. It is also a requirement that CaSS be able to resolve conflicting data in a documented, consistent, and potentially configurable manner.</p> <p>Another phenomenon that is frequently mentioned and that is supported by cognitive science as well as real-world experience is that skills and knowledge can deteriorate or be lost over time unless they are practiced or reinforced. Although it is hard to find existing systems that take this into account when maintaining competency records, in designing CaSS it was considered a requirement that CaSS be able to associate decay functions with reported competencies.</p> <h3 id="assertions-rather-than-records"><a href="#assertions-rather-than-records" class="header-anchor">#</a> Assertions Rather than Records</h3> <p>Assessments can vary wildly with regard to <a href="http://www.hr-guide.com/data/G362.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reliability and validity<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>. In most cases, the reliability and validity of an assessment will not be known, and even in the case of assessments vetted by professional psychometricians, it is naive to treat assessment results as proving that an individual possesses a given competency. Moreover, claims of competency collected by CaSS may not even be based on an assessment, e.g. they could be derived from self-declarations or made under the assumption that a learner who has completed an activity has mastered the skills and knowledge addressed by that activity.  For this reason, CaSS takes the generally accepted view that information about the competencies held by an individual consists of competency assertions.

CaSS does this by starting with the root node R and retrieving all relations to other competencies. Each such relation defines an edge in the graph with nodes representing the two related competencies. If the same competency appears in two relations, it is represented twice by two different nodes. The edges are labelled with the relations (i.e. A requires B, A isRequiredBy B, A broadens B, A narrows B, or A is equivalent to B). This process is then repeated for each node in the graph, adding any relations that have not previously been retrieved and is iterated until no more relations can be found.</p> <p>The result is a tree G with root R.</p> <h3 id="step-2"><a href="#step-2" class="header-anchor">#</a> STEP 2</h3> <p>The next steps involve determining the values of the nodes.

Each roll-up rule is considered to be an assertion, but have the values I or U in addition to T or F.</p> <p>The value of a node is set to:</p> <ul><li><strong>U</strong> if all assertions are U or no assertions exist</li> <li><strong>T</strong> if all assertions about that node are T or U</li> <li><strong>F</strong> if all assertions about that node are F or U</li> <li><strong>I</strong> otherwise</li></ul> <h3 id="step-4"><a href="#step-4" class="header-anchor">#</a> STEP 4</h3> <p>The next step is to examine all parents of leaf nodes. In doing so, the values of each child of a node are considered assertions in the following way, where:</p> <ul><li><strong>P</strong> is the parent node</li> <li><strong>C</strong> is the child node</li></ul> <p>Rules:</p> <ul><li>If P broadens C, and C = F, then P is asserted to be F (holding P implies holding C)</li> <li>If P narrows C, and C = T, then P is asserted to be T (holding C implies holding P)</li> <li>If P requires C, and C = F, then P is asserted to be F</li> <li>If P is required by C, and C = T, then P is asserted to be T</li> <li>If P is equivalent to C, the value of C is asserted for P (T, F or I)</li></ul> <p>The values of all the parent nodes P are computed as in STEP 3 using direct assertions about the parent nodes, the assertions derived from all child nodes as above, and all roll-up rules.

A reputation is a number in the closed interval [0,1] with 0 meaning that the assertions from the provider are unreliable and 1 meaning the provider’s assertions are completely reliable. Best practices for determining or interpreting the value of a reputation are to be determined.</li> <li>Future implementations may include reputations for agents as well.</li> <li>Instead of creating duplicate nodes to create a tree, the processing graph will start out as a directed graph (A → B if A broadens or requires B) and cycles will be collapsed into equivalence classes represented by a single node. In this setup, each competency will be represented only once in the graph.</li> <li>The value of each node will be a real number in the closed interval [-1,1]. Negative numbers indicate the belief that an identity does not hold a competency. The value derived from an assertion will be the product of the confidence and ±1 (-1 for a negative assertion and +1 for a positive assertion), which may additionally be adjusted based on reputation.</li> <li>The graph will be processed depth first using a formula that weighs multiple assertions to derive a value.</li> <li>The associated API will be configurable to convert values of the root node to scales such as 1 - 4 or a discrete grading system. This mimics computations such as “grade point average” and is compatible with the way that certain learning management systems view competency assertions.</li> <li>We anticipate support for more sophisticated roll-up rules that can, for example, require that the sum of the confidences of multiple assertions exceed some threshold.</li></ul></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
