Perhaps some of the lessons learned and tools created during its development will benefit you on other projects. -- CASS Team</p> <h2 id="about-cass"><a href="#about-cass" class="header-anchor">#</a> About CaSS</h2> <p>CaSS is open-source software that enables users and other systems to define, store, manage, and access data objects called competencies that are organized into structured collections called frameworks, and to report, store, and retrieve assertions about the competencies held by an individual.</p> <p>CaSS consists of open source code that provides two basic sets of services intended for use by applications that support competency-based approaches to education, training, and workforce development. The goal of CaSS is to enable these applications to share competencies and related information about learners and learning resources in an interoperable and secure manner. The basic services provided by CaSS are used by applications to:</p> <ul><li>Define, store, manage, and access objects called competencies that are organized into structured collections called frameworks. Competencies can represent competencies, skills, knowledge, abilities, traits, learning objectives, learning outcomes, and other similar constructs that define performance, mastery, attainment, or capabilities. Frameworks are structured collections of competencies associated with a knowledge domain, a domain of endeavor, a job, or a task with structure defined by relations among the competencies they (or other frameworks) contain. CaSS provides persistent, unique URLs that multiple applications can use to access and reference the same frameworks and competencies.</li> <li>Store assertions about the competencies held by an individual (or team), and compile assertions and other data into profiles that describe a learner’s current state. CaSS is designed to respond to queries from other applications that, for instance, ask whether an individual X holds a competency Y (at performance level Z). Subject to authorization and adherence to privacy protection policies, CaSS will answer yes or no and might include a number indicating its confidence in the answer, a link to evidence, and an expiry date. In addition, CaSS can collect assertions and other data from multiple sources and apply relations and rules to formulate a response to a query.</li></ul> <h3 id="intended-scope"><a href="#intended-scope" class="header-anchor">#</a> Intended Scope</h3> <p>CaSS is intended to allow competencies and competency frameworks to be defined, published, accessed, and applied in any size jurisdiction, ranging from a single learning system to an organization, a community of practice, or the entire world. The CaSS project believes that this capability is achievable and is needed to support competency-based approaches to training, education, credentialing, and career management. In fact, there already exist services such as the <a href="http://www.achievementstandards.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Achievement Standards Network<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a> and <a href="https://www.onetonline.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">O*Net<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a> that do this. Sharing assertions of competency among collaborating systems is another goal. Currently, this is done by using credentials as intermediaries, and the CaSS project believes that significant value can be achieved by enabling such sharing with closed ecosystems that consist of collaborating systems deployed by a training organization, educational institution, corporation, government agency, or a similar organization. Although the CaSS project has looked at broader use cases, the current version of CaSS therefore assumes that it is operating within such an ecosystem.</p> <h3 id="services-not-end-user-applications"><a href="#services-not-end-user-applications" class="header-anchor">#</a> Services, not End-user Applications</h3> <p>Although the CaSS project is providing reference implementations of end-user applications that use the CaSS services, the CaSS services themselves are not end-user applications. They enable learning management systems, HR systems, talent management systems, student information systems, MOOCS, intelligent tutoring systems, learning resource repositories and registries, competency management systems, and other learning- and training-related applications to exchange data through software, but end-users do not interact directly with the services.</p> <h3 id="infrastructure-and-interoperability-but-not-another-standard"><a href="#infrastructure-and-interoperability-but-not-another-standard" class="header-anchor">#</a> Infrastructure and Interoperability, but not Another Standard</h3> <p>CaSS is infrastructure that is intended to promote interoperability among software systems that produce and consume competencies and competency assertions.  As expected, CaSS documentation specifies how these systems must receive and transmit data, and to the extent that systems must conform to these specifications to use CaSS. CaSS documentation also specifies the object models (expressed as Linked Data schema) that CaSS uses to internally store competencies, frameworks, and assertions, and to represent alignments between resources and competencies; None of these internal representations are intended to be standards. To the contrary, multiple standards exist and are in development for these purposes.  The CaSS project supports these standards as import and export formats and does not to try to create yet another one.</p> <p><img src="/docs/assets/img/cass-overview-comic.5b9fa605.png" alt="XKCD Comic"></p> <h3 id="collaboration"><a href="#collaboration" class="header-anchor">#</a> Collaboration</h3> <p>The CaSS Project is a community effort that strives to incorporate, support, and add value to the work of the many individuals and organizations involved in competency-based education and training.

Each level should have performance criteria (also called assessment or evaluation criteria).

However, there are two different types of “levels” that are often confused: Performance levels of the same skill or ability (or indications of knowledge) and levels of advancement in rank or the ability to perform a job. In the latter case, advanced levels of a competency usually requires additional and different skills than lower levels: A black belt karate master can do things that a white belt cannot, and advancement from a junior to intermediate to senior programmer involves performing new tasks, not just writing the same type of code better or more efficiently.</p></div> <p>When defining competencies and frameworks for human interpretation, these two types of levels can be conflated without causing too much harm, but treating levels of advancement as levels of performance leads to computational problems when trying to make inferences about sub-competencies. As a result, it is best practice to treat different levels of advancement as distinct competencies rather than to relate them with the Performance Level object. Future versions of CaSS will use the relation “is a level of” and “is a more advanced level of” to indicate the connection, which will also allow categorical competencies such as “karate” to be defined in addition to their levels.</p> <h3 id="relation"><a href="#relation" class="header-anchor">#</a> Relation</h3> <p>Relations are statements that relate two competencies (in the same or different frameworks). The standard relationships in the current release of CaSS include “requires,” “is required by,” “narrows,” “broadens,” “is the same as,” and “is equivalent to.”</p> <p>Relations that describe how competencies are related could be represented as properties on the competencies, however, several use cases include third parties creating new relationships between competencies.

CaSS Adapters can be built into external systems or be implemented as middleware that sits between an external system and a CaSS instance.  CaSS Adapters are used by a CaSS instance to retrieve assertions about an individual’s competencies from external systems. CaSS Adapters may also be used by external systems to query CaSS about individual competencies and to receive answers to such queries in their preferred format.</p> <p><a href="/docs/guide/interoperability/#adapters-overview">Several CaSS adapters</a> come with the CaSS code distribution, including an xAPI adapter for retrieving <a href="https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">xAPI statements<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a> from a Learning Record Store (LRS).

An assertion includes the identity of the individual (or <strong>subject</strong>) and the competency. It can also include the identity of the agent making the assertion, a performance level, a link to evidence, a <strong>confidence</strong> (a number between 0 and 1), a timestamp, and an expiration time.</p> <p><img src="/docs/assets/img/cass_overview_assertion_format.0217138d.png" alt="CaSS Assertion Format"></p> <p>Assertion processors maintain a configurable list of systems that can provide them with assertions. This list could consist of only one CaSS instance, in which case that instance acts as a store for competency-based learner profiles, but it can also include other systems that might make or transmit assertions. When an assertion processor receives a query, it looks at what other competencies might be related to the queried competency through roll-up rules and framework relationships, and the processor retrieves information about these as well as about the target competency. The processor then follows an algorithm that computes a single conclusion about the target competency (and target performance level, if relevant) taking into consideration roll-up rules, relationships, confidence, and (in some cases) the reliability of collaborating systems.</p> <p>The current CaSS distribution includes a JavaScript Assertion Processor. This enables assertion processing to be done within client applications. Server-side versions may be implemented as part of an adapter or Node application. Future plans include a server-side version that will act as an adapter for the TLA’s profile API.</p> <h2 id="security-and-privacy"><a href="#security-and-privacy" class="header-anchor">#</a> Security and Privacy</h2> <p>Security and privacy are strongly enforced in CaSS. The CaSS project has developed a <a href="/dev/security/kbac-specification">security framework</a> that uses “Key-based Access Control” (KBAC) based on cryptographic methods found in Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). This approach was guided by the following requirements:</p> <ul><li>Prevent sensitive information (which in CaSS includes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">personally identifiable information (PII)<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>) and competency assertions) from being discovered or read by any unauthorized individual.</li> <li>Enable access to information to be controlled by its “owner.” The owner of an assertion about an individual’s competencies may be the individual, but it may also be the individual’s employer or another type of entity. Note that controlling access is not the same as controlling the contents of an assertion, which an owner cannot typically change.</li> <li>Enable recipients of sensitive information to verify that it is valid and that no unauthorized tampering or alteration has occurred.</li> <li>Enable a wide variety of privacy policies to be implemented, ranging from open policies with no privacy or data protection to highly secure policies that, for example, prevent CaSS from reporting whether or not any assertion exists about an individual unless the requesting system is on a trusted list and securely authenticates itself.</li> <li>Protect privacy while supporting the use of anonymized “open data” for the purpose of analyzing and improving learning and training systems and for other research purposes.</li></ul> <h3 id="cass-security-framework"><a href="#cass-security-framework" class="header-anchor">#</a> CaSS Security Framework</h3> <p>The CaSS security framework assigns an identity to each person, organization, software system, or group. Identities are stored in the CaSS identity manager as 2048 bit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">public RSA keys<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>. In CaSS implementations, these are mapped externally to meaningful identifiers, but within CaSS, and when included in a CaSS object such as an assertion about someone’s competency, they are just 2048 bit pseudo-identifiers that contain no PII and require additional mappings to refer to individuals.</p> <p>CaSS objects are JSON-LD objects that can be stored open to the public (unencrypted) or privately (encrypted) in the CaSS repository. Objects can be transmitted to other systems as plain text if desired, but by default objects in transit are encrypted and contain additional signatures that can be used to verify that they have not been altered and that specify which identities have the following permissions:</p> <ul><li><strong>Read</strong>: Decrypt and read the object</li> <li><strong>Edit</strong>: Read, change, and re-publish the object or specified properties of the object</li> <li><strong>Delete</strong>: Delete an object (only applies to the CaSS Repository)</li> <li><strong>Control</strong>: Grant and revoke permissions</li></ul> <p>CaSS uses public/private key encryption and signature methods to ensure that only those identities assigned the above permissions can perform the corresponding tasks. For example, if someone with the right to read an object but not the right to edit it nonetheless opens it, edits it, and re-saves it, then the unpermitted tampering will be immediately detected by any CaSS instance or any system using secure versions of the CaSS APIs and can be detected using standard means by any third party.</p> <p>In CaSS, identities, and hence the above permissions, can be assigned to groups as well as individuals. CaSS assumes that group membership can be verified externally to CaSS. Identities can also be assigned to systems, such as an LMS or an HR system.</p> <h3 id="roles-in-cass-applications"><a href="#roles-in-cass-applications" class="header-anchor">#</a> Roles in CaSS Applications</h3> <p>CaSS itself only supports permissions, and only does this on an object-by-object basis. Roles and associated policies are defined in applications that use CaSS services. It is up to these applications to assign appropriate permissions to CaSS objects. Once assigned, however, any CaSS instance will enforce these permissions and unauthorized actions will be either prevented (read actions) or revealed (other actions).</p> <p><img src="/docs/assets/img/cass_overview_roles.d78926db.png" alt="CaSS Roles"></p> <h3 id="analysis-of-kbac-security"><a href="#analysis-of-kbac-security" class="header-anchor">#</a> Analysis of KBAC Security</h3> <p>The effectiveness of KBAC Security is analyzed in a <a href="/dev/security/kbac-threat-model">Threat Model</a> document. The document shows how KBAC prevents common threats and the impact should systems become compromised.</p> <p>Implementers, users, and administrator should note that KBAC will not prevent attacks based on compromising end user applications, e.g. attacks that steal information from an end-user’s browser after it has been decrypted and displayed, attacks that compromise a server that provides an end-user application, or attacks that steal a user’s password from a web browser. These attacks are also analyzed in the Threat Model under the “Client-side Attacks” tab.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
