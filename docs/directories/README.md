## Navigating to a Directory 

Directories that you have created can be viewed by clicking on a Directory 
icon on the left side bar highlighted by the red box in the image below. If 
you have created multiple directories, then you will see multiple directory 
icons (one for each created directory). 

![Directory Management - Directories Icon](/docs/directory-icon.png)

Click on a Directory icon to open the directory. Once opened, you will see 
the contents of the selected directory. A directory can contain subdirectories, frameworks, and resources.

### Navigating with the Directory Path

The path for the selected directory is located in the breadcrumb navigation directly above the contents of the directory. 

![Directory Management - Directory Path](/docs/directory-breadcrumbs.png)

Click on a directory or subdirectory name in the path to show
items within that directory or subdirectory. If the directory does not show any 
items listed then it is empty. 

Click on "CaSS" in the breadcrumb navigation to show all available items. This list includes all directories, subdirectories, frameworks, and resources within public directories and directories that you have created.

## Using the Information Panel
 
For more details and options for an item in the current directory, click on the 
item name or the arrow to the right of the item. Information about the item will show on a side panel to the right of the directory list.

![Directory Management - Directory Information](/docs/directory-information.png)

The type of item (Directory, Framework, or Resource) along with the item name is shown in the top section of the Information panel. The type of item being viewed and its properties determines the contents available within the information panel.
