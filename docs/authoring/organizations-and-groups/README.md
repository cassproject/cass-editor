In CaSS Authoring Tools, user groups provide the capability to assign multiple users the ability to share permissions across an organization or team. Members of a group are granted access to any CaSS framework or competency that the group has been explicitly assigned. [Please refer to the user and groups section](~@img/users-and-groups/).
