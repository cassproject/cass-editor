# Managing Users and Sharing

Directories, Frameworks, and Resources can be shared with other users either by sharing a link to the item or by adding owners and readers (with Admin or View privileges) to the item.

You can only manage users on an item if you are an owner (listed as *Admin*) for the item.

## Sharing a Link to a Directory or Framework

To copy a link to a directory or framework:
* Click on the name of the item to show its Information on the right side panel.
* In the ***Details*** section of the ***Information panel***, click on ***copy link***
    * This copies the shareable link to your clipboard

This option offers a method for sharing directories, given that exporting directories is not available at this time.

A dialogue window shows options for adding Users or Groups to the item. You can:
* View the current list of users with privileges (*Admin* or *View*)
* Add new users or organizations
* Delete current users or organizations

The dialogue has an option to set the item as ***Public*** or ***Private***
* **Public** items will be viewable by all users
  * Public frameworks can be exported when opened

For directories and frameworks, a shareable link shows at the top of the window and provides a button to copy the link to your clipboard. This option offers a method for sharing directories, given that exporting directories is not available at this time.
