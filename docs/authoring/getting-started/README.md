## Application Login

:::warning Note
This section is not applicable to Credential Engine instances of CAT.
:::

By default, most CAT functionality is available without being logged in.
You can search for, create, and manage public frameworks, competencies,
and other CaSS data. Some tools, however, will not be available until
after going through the login process. Accessing secure CaSS data,
securing your own CaSS data, and explicitly granting access and
permissions to owned data all requires you to be logged into the
environment. More details about managing user groups and data
permissions can be found in the corresponding sections.

The ***login button*** can be accessed through the application navigation
menu.

## Creating an Account

From the landing page users have the option to login or create a new
account to access the CaSS Authoring Tool. At the login page users have
the option to select ***create account*** shown below.

![CAT Login - Create Account Button](/v1.5/authoring/create-account-button.png)

From here, users will be prompted to input basic information required to
register their account with the CaSS Authoring Tool.

Once users have successfully entered the required information, they can
hit ***create*** to begin the registration of their account. Once
successfully registered, you will be automatically logged into the
application.
