# Creating and Editing

**Assertion management is only available to logged in users, ensure you are logged in to the application before continuing.**

## Enabling Assertion Management

Open any framework and you should be presented with a *manage assertions* button in the top toolbar

To return to the framework editing mode, simply press the *stop managing assertions* button in the top toolbar

## Choosing a Subject

You can choose to make assertions about yourself, or another user in the system. In order to change the subject of your assertions, click the *myself* button and select a new user from the resulting dialog.

## Creating an Assertion

Once in the assertion management mode, the competencies in the framework will display new controls to create either a positive or negative assertion, indicating that a user can or cannot perform the competency respectively.

Clicking the *I can* button will generate a positive assertion for that competency and display an input field allowing you to provide evidence in the form of text or a link to support the assertion. Press *enter* on your keyboard after entering the evidence into the input field to attach it to your assertion.

The evidence will appear in a section underneath the input field, along with a button to delete that evidence if desired.

## Deleting an Assertion

To delete an assertion, simply click the same button that was used to create the assertion. In this case, the *I can* button.

## Adding a Badge

You can add a badge to a positive assertion by clicking the *add badge* button.

This will generate a url for the badge that can be viewed by clicking the *view badge* button and then shared.
