# Taxonomy Management

In Credential Engine instances of CAT, taxonomies are referred to as ***concept schemes***.

Taxonomies can be used to categorize and label competencies in frameworks. The ***Taxonomies page*** can be visited by clicking on the ***Taxonomies icon*** on the left side bar highlighted by the red box in the image below.

![CAT Taxonomy Management - Taxonomies Icon](/v1.5/authoring/taxonomies-icon.png)

On this page, taxonomies are shown with their names in bold. Beneath the name, you can see when it was created and last modified. If you have permission to edit the taxonomy, it will say ***Editable***.

## Sorting and Filtering Taxonomies

You can sort and filter the list of taxonomies by clicking the ***filter button*** next to the search bar. The button next to it clears any filters you’ve applied.

The filter button will open up a side panel to the right of the taxonomy list with options to sort and filter the list.

A new taxonomy can be created within CaSS Authoring Tools by pressing the ***Create New*** button at the top of the taxonomy management page.

When you click on the ***Create New*** button to create a new taxonomy, you will be required to enter a Taxonomy Name to your new taxonomy. Additional properties can be added by clicking the ***add property*** button.

## Adding Concepts to Taxonomies

To add concepts to your taxonomy, click the ***add concept*** button below the taxonomy details.

You can construct a hierarchy of concepts by checking the box to the left of a concept. The ***add concept*** button text will change to ***add child***, which you can click to place a concept underneath the one you’ve checked.

A modal will appear and you can edit the taxonomy or concept’s properties. This modal also allows you to delete the concept or taxonomy and export the object. Click ***done*** when you’ve finished making changes.

## Managing Users and Sharing a Taxonomy

To control who can view and edit a taxonomy you own, click the ***manage users*** button highlighted in red in the image below.

![CAT Taxonomy Management - Manage Users Button](/v1.5/authoring/taxonomies-users-button.png)

You can see who the admins and viewers of your taxonomy are, and add or remove users and organizations. This view also has a shareable link to your taxonomy that you can copy to your clipboard and give to someone else.

## Viewing Taxonomies and Concepts in More Detail

By default, only primary properties are shown on a taxonomy and concepts. To see some additional properties, click ***secondary*** in the panel at the top of the screen.

## Exporting a Taxonomy

Once you’ve created or imported a new taxonomy, exporting the taxonomy is a relatively simple process. Users must first view their taxonomies through the ***taxonomy tab*** in the CaSS Authoring Tool and select the desired taxonomy to be exported. Once the taxonomy is selected, users can select the ***export button*** at the top of the screen and will be prompted to choose their desired file format to export that taxonomy.

![CAT Taxonomy Management - Export Button](/v1.5/authoring/exporting-frameworks.png)

Users will be prompted with the window displayed below and can select their desired file format from the options provided in the dropdown menu.

![CAT Taxonomy Management - Export Oprtions](/v1.5/authoring/select-option-export.png)

Once the desired format is selected users can select the ***export file button*** at the bottom right corner of the window and the taxonomy will be downloaded to your computer or opened in a new tab of your browser.

## Importing a Taxonomy

The process of importing a new taxonomy is also relatively simple. From the taxonomy tab on the sidebar, users have the ability to view all existing taxonomies within the system. At the top of the page is a list of options which allow users to import and create new taxonomies into the database of existing taxonomies.

![CAT Taxonomy Management - Import Button ](/v1.5/authoring/taxonomy-import-button.png)

After clicking the ***import taxonomy button*** users will be prompted with a new page where they have the ability to select the source of the taxonomy they are trying to import. Users have the ability to upload *csv* and *json* files. Examples and templates are linked from the panel on the right side of the screen. Users can drag the taxonomy into the dotted window displayed below.

![CAT Taxonomy Management - Import Page](/v1.5/authoring/taxonomy-import-page.png)

Once imported users can select the process files button and the desired taxonomy will be imported into the your CaSS Authoring Tool database.
