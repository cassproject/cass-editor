# Managing Default Users

By default, the creator of a CaSS framework, competency, or other object is assigned as the sole owner of that record. By using the ***user configuration*** section of the configuration, other specified users and groups can be assigned as owners and readers to objects created in the framework/competency editor that use the configuration.
