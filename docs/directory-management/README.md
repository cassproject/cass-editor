# Finding and Editing

Directories can be used to orgranize competency frameworks and resources into collections. A directory can contain subdirectories, frameworks, and resources. Items can be copied or moved into and out of directories. 

![Directory Management - Directory List](/docs/directory-list.png)

## Navigating to a Directory 

Directories that you have created or you have access to can be viewed by clicking on a Directory icon on the left side bar highlighted by the red box in the image below. If you have access to multiple directories, then you will see multiple directory icons (one for each created directory). 

![Directory Management - Directories Icon](/docs/directory-icon.png)

Click on a Directory icon to open the directory. Once opened, you will see the contents of the selected directory. If the directory does not show any items listed then it is empty. 

![Directory Management - Directory List](/docs/directory-list.png)

### Navigating with the Directory Path

The path for the selected directory is located in the breadcrumb navigation directly above the contents of the directory. 

![Directory Management - Directory Path](/docs/directory-breadcrumbs.png)

Click on a directory or subdirectory name in the path to show items within that directory or subdirectory. If the directory does not show any items listed then it is empty. 

Click on "CaSS" in the breadcrumb navigation to show all available items. This list includes all directories, subdirectories, frameworks, and resources within public directories, directories that you have created, and any other directories that you have access to.

### Navigating to a Directory from a Framework

If a framework exists within a directory, then a link to its parent directory is available when viewing the framework. To view the directory that a framework is in, click on "go to directory" in the top right corner as outlined in red below.

## Opening an Item

Double-click on any item within a directory (including another directory) to open that item.

## Viewing an Item in More Detail
 
For more details and options for an item in the current directory, click on the item name or the arrow to the right of the item. Information about the item will show on a side panel to the right of the directory list.

![Directory Management - Directory Information](/docs/directory-information.png)

The type of item (Directory, Framework, or Resource) along with the item name is shown in the top section of the Information panel. The type of item being viewed and its properties determines the contents available within the information panel.

If the type of item is a Competency, then the details and options within the Information panel will refer to the Framework that the Competency is within.

If the item is not currently open, then a button providing the option to open that item is available under the name of the item. 

Not all options listed below are available on all items.

- **Details** (only available for directories and frameworks)
    - **Last Modified** - The date that this item was last modified

## Searching for Items from the Directory View
