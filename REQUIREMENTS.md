## High Level Requirement

- The CaSS Editor shall have a method for administrators to define a CaSS Editor configurations and for users to select configurations. Configurations shall designate: Properties of frameworks competencies types that competencies can have, and whether authors can define new types relationships that competencies can have levels that competencies can have When a configuration is selected, the CaSS Editor user interface shall reflect the parameters in the configuration and CaSS shall store data in accordance with the configuration (See 2.1.4). This does not mean that frameworks or competencies created in a different configuration will not display or be available. Note that all objects in CaSS have properties such as URLs, creation date, revision date, version, etc. These do not need to be designated in configurations.
- Configurations shall designate which properties are required, primary, secondary, and tertiary. The CaSS Editor shall prevent users from defining or saving objects with missing required properties The CaSS Editor should always show users the primary properties of an object Users should be able to quickly see (and edit if appropriate) the secondary properties of an object, although they may be omitted from a view Tertiary properties may be omitted from a view but shall be reachable for viewing and editing.
- Configurations shall include definitions of all properties. Users shall be able to see the definitions of all properties from the CaSS Editor UI (e.g. as tooltips)
- Configurations shall map each property to the CaSS schema. These mappings shall be documented and shall be reused to the greatest extent possible so that configurations that have the same properties map these properties to the same schema elements. CaSS Editor Users shall not have the ability to define properties or use schema elements that are not in the configuration unless those properties and elements are in the default configuration.
- Configurations shall define users, groups (roles), and permissions as needed to support CaSS user management and security in accordance with the instance of CaSS and the learning system in which it functions. These elements of the configuration will control which users or user roles can perform what CRUD operations on objects via CaSS Editor. The list of possible permissions for frameworks (and competencies) are: Own Edit Comment View (each subsumes the next – as in Google Drive)
- As in Google Drive, a configuration shall designate whether an editor can add other editors. (Owners shall always be able to add or delete permissions). As in Google Drive, there shall be a mechanism for owners to make other users into owners and for administrators to change ownership.
- Configurations may define the types of alignments that competencies can have with resources. These alignments are controlled vocabulary (see default below).
- Configurations may designate an xAPI profile and connected LRSs. They may also designate how assertions are to be constructed from xAPI statements and alignments, i.e. how an alignment plus a verb in an xAPI statement plus a status in an xAPI statement translates into an assertion.
- Configurations may define how relationships are to be interpreted vis a vis roll-up. These are default rules that can be overridden or augmented by specific roll-up rules. As an example, if A requires B, the configuration should not allow CaSS to conclude that an entity possesses A but not B.
- There shall be a default configuration. In the default configuration, Frameworks shall have names, descriptions, owners, and authors. Names are required. The others are primary. Competencies shall have Names as required properties Description and type as primary properties (note: relationships are also primary but handled differently) Levels, associated assessments, rubrics, associated resources as secondary properties Context (with open vocabulary), domain [cognitive, affective, psychomotor] as tertiary properties The types of competencies shall be “competency” “knowledge” “skill” and “ability”. Relationships shall be “Equivalent” “Similar” “Requires” (with inverse “Prerequisite”) “Contains” (with inverse “Is Part Of”). Levels shall be “beginner” “intermediate” and “advanced” (which are optional, and which are attainment levels).
- In the default configuration: It shall be possible to associate rubrics with competencies. Rubrics shall define criteria for not meeting, meeting, and exceeding expected performance for each competency at each level. It shall be possible to associate resources with competencies using the tags “teaches” “assesses” and “defines.”
- If an LRS is integrated with CaSS, then there shall be a default xAPI profile in which successful completion of a resource that teaches a competency, or successful completion of an assessment that assesses the competency, generates an assertion to the effect that the learner has the given competency. The “confidence” values for “teaches” and “assesses” shall be configurable. (Default values of .5 and 1 may be reasonable)
- There shall be a CFD configuration. This configuration shall support DACUM-inspired competency framework development processes.
- There shall be an AETC configuration.
- The CaSS Editor shall have a “user-friendly” framework and competency authoring and editing tool that: saves objects when changed stores a history of changes while an object is being edited can undo changes to an object being edited automatically versions frameworks enable users to find older versions revert to them (if their permissions allow this)
- The CaSS Editor shall enable users to search for existing frameworks. The search function shall search on framework metadata and shall be designed to support rapid searching among thousands of frameworks. Results should be ranked and shall be restricted to frameworks for which the user has “view” permission at minimum.
- Search results should be sortable by best match (default) / name / last updated / owner
- Users should be able to search for frameworks: That were developed with the current configuration That are owned by the current owner That are owned by a specific owner That contains competencies whose properties match a given search term.
- Users shall be able to open a framework that is shown in the results of a search. Opening a framework shall enable the user to quickly begin editing the competencies in the frameworks. The user should be able to see and edit framework properties, but apart from the framework title, it is more important that users get to the actual content of the framework (i.e. the competencies in the framework).
- The CaSS Editor shall enable users to see a list of their recently opened frameworks and open one from that list
- The CaSS Editor shall enable users to search for competencies within a framework. Searches should look in required and primary properties. Results should be sortable according to those fields (a good model is Google Flights). Users shall be able to open a competency from the search list.
- Opening a competency should enable users to quickly get to editing the primary properties of the competency and shall also provide the user with a means of understanding where the competency fits within the framework.
- Editing should behave as in Google Docs, i.e. changes take place when made, with the possibility of undoing.
- When a competency is open (i.e. can be edited), secondary properties should be one click away and it should be possible to view and edit all properties.
- The CaSS Editor shall enable users to search for competencies within a framework. Searches should look in required and primary properties. Results should be sortable according to those fields (a good model is Google Flights).
- Users shall be able to search in non-primary fields. Such search may require added clicks.
- The CaSS Editor shall enable authors to search for competencies They have defined that are not in a framework Are in frameworks they own Are in public frameworks Are in frameworks owned by the author’s group (as defined in a configuration) The default behavior when searching for competencies from within an opened framework is to search that framework only. This behavior shall be easily toggled to search across all frameworks. Other choices (as above) shall be selectable.
- The CaSS Editor shall enable users to search for competencies in a specific set of frameworks
- When searching for competencies from within an opened framework, authorized users shall be able to add competencies from the results list to the framework. This action shall be simple and intuitive and shall include placing the new competencies within the structure of the opened framework.
- Existing competencies from other frameworks (or that exist as competencies not in a framework) can be added to an open framework as links or as copies. The owner of a linked competency is the owner of the original competency and it cannot be edited when added to a new framework. A copied competency is owned by the copier. If a user attempts to edit a competency that has been added as a link, the user should be told that it is a link and that the user does not have permission to edit it.
- The relationships available for competencies in a framework shall default to those specified in the current configuration
- Administrators shall be able to edit the available relationships for a given framework, overriding the defaults.
- Relationships shall be actionable or not actionable. An actionable relationship includes logic that applies to the processing of assertions. The CaSS Editor shall support the definition of non-actionable relationships between any competency and any other competency available to the user through the CaSS Editor.
- A relationship is hierarchical if it defines a hierarchy among competencies in a framework. The CaSS Editor shall enable relationships to be designated as hierarchical and shall associate one of the SKOS terms broadens or narrows with the relationship in accordance with the perceived direction of the hierarchical relationship.
- The CaSS Editor shall support the definition of actionable equivalence relationships between a competency and any other competency available to the user through the CaSS Editor. When two competencies are equivalent, the default behavior CaSS shall be to automatically interpret an assertion about either of them as an assertion about both.
- The CaSS Editor shall support the definition of actionable “requires” relationships between a competency and any other competency available to the user through the CaSS Editor. When A requires B, the default behavior CaSS shall be, in the case of “binary” assertion processing where competencies are either held or not, that A cannot be held if B is not held. (It is less clear that the converse should be true, although that is acceptable behavior).
- The CaSS Editor shall support the definition of roll-up rules that create assertions about a competency A from estimates of whether an individual holds competencies B1,…,Bn, where the Bi are the immediate sub-competencies of A in the directed graph defined by translating all hierarchical relationships into broadens relationships and the assertion about A need only be generated if CaSS has an estimates for all Bi.
- The CaSS Editor shall support the definition of other types of actionable relationships and corresponding CaSS behaviors.
- The CaSS Editor shall provide the user with a way to see all competencies related to a given competency. This view shall indicate the relationships. If a user has permission to edit the actions associated with a relationship, the view shall indicate that such actions exist and enable the user to open an action for editing.
- The CaSS Editor shall provide the user with a method to remove or add relationships to a given competency. This shall be part of the competency editor defined above.
- A user should be able to see all competencies related to a given competency via a specified relationship or set of relationships.
- The default number of levels displayed in a hierarchy should be computed to optimize the display. (This will override the default).
- The CaSS Editor shall provide a separate capability to define relationships among competencies independently of editing the competencies. This capability shall enable the user to search for two competencies and define a relationship between them. The selection of relationships shall be determined by the framework in which the source competency lives or, if the source competency is not in a framework, by the default configuration. The search capabilities shall include the ability to search by keyword, which shall search in the required and primary fields of competencies, and to filter by framework.
- If a competency has equivalent competencies (linked or related through an equality relationship) in multiple frameworks, the user shall be alerted to this fact and shall be able to see which frameworks contain the competency. Only one copy should appear on the search result list, which shall be the master copy in the case of links.
- The CaSS Editor shall provide a framework crosswalk tool (FCT) that enables a user to view and edit alignments between competencies in two frameworks F and G. This tool shall allow filtered search for frameworks, and once selected, filtered search in both frameworks and shall provide the user with a way to define any relationship available in F between any competency in F and any competency in G. (This means that the user can search for objects using search terms, can search in specific properties, and can filter search results by those properties – which is also required for other editing functions in CaSS Editor). Filtering shall include all required and primary properties. The tool should allow for users to select a set of competencies in F and one competency in G and define the same relationship between all selected competencies in F and the competency in G.
- The FCT should behave as other editing tools in the sense that it automatically saves relationships, enable multiple undo actions, and automatically versions BOTH frameworks
- The FCT should allow the user to select a single competency in F, select multiple competencies in G, define the same relationship between the competency in F an all selected competencies in G. (Note that this is not symmetric with 2.5.15 because the allowable relationships are those allowed in F only.)
- The FCT should allow administrators to define criteria that are then used to automatically create alignments. Criteria are Boolean combinations of regular expressions involving properties of competencies in two frameworks, an unspecified source framework S and an unspecified target framework T (i.e., S and T are variables whose values are frameworks), that can be applied to pairs of competencies A in S and B in T, plus a relationship R that is available for competencies in S. The Administrators shall be able to create, edit and save criteria and give criteria names. Criteria shall be restricted to properties whose value is text. However, if the property is associated resources, criteria shall include the ability to examine the file name and text in such resources and to restrict such examination to resources that are related via one or more of the alignments teaches, assesses, and defines.
- Given two frameworks F and G selected in the FCT, a criterion is admissible if the properties it references in the source and target frameworks are properties that exist in F and G. Users shall be able to see and select from among admissible criteria. Users shall be able to select all or some competencies in F and G (via search), select a criterion, and apply the criterion. The CaSS Editor shall then define the relationship R in the criterion for all A in F and B in G that satisfy the criterion.
- The CaSS Editor shall include a “semantic alignment” criterion that is defined for all frameworks that themselves meet a set of criteria that determine whether semantic alignment is likely to produce acceptable results and that may include the existence of a trained model for extracting meaning in the subject matter of the framework, the presence of sufficient text, and other criteria (to be determined by NLP / ML experts). The semantic alignment criterion shall be available to all users for all frameworks for which semantic alignment is likely to produce acceptable results.
- The CaSS Editor may also provide the ability to define criteria using a semantic-syntactic matching and other NLP-based methods for determining when a relationship should hold.
- Users shall be able to inspect the full set of relationships between two selected frameworks F and G in a way that allows the user to browse and delete them. This function shall focus on usability and, in the case of medium to large frameworks, avoid information overload and provide reasonable awareness to the user when there are uninspected relationships.
- In the above, users should be able to add new relationships between a competency in F and a competency in G if both are visible to the user as the user is inspecting the frameworks.
- The CaSS Editor shall have a user-friendly Resource Alignment Tool (RAT) that allows resources to be associated with existing competencies. (This accomplishes the same end as doing so from within a framework/competency editor, but with a different perspective.)
- For the purposes of the RAT, a resource is an object with a URI.
- The RAT shall have an interface that enables a user to search for and select a competency and optionally a relationship (teaches, assesses, or defines) and to associate one or more resources in an intuitive manner (e.g. via search or drag-and-drop) with the selected competency.
- The RAT may have a more complex interface that enables authors to search for resources and select a set of resources from the resulting list, search for competencies (filtered search), and associate competencies in the search results with resources in the search results using the tags teaches, assesses, and defines.
- Users with permission to make comments shall be able to make comments on competencies in an open framework. Users with permission to comment on a framework shall be able to make comments about that framework. Comments on a framework should be clearly scoped to the framework and distinguishable from comments about individual competencies.
- Users shall be able to edit their own comments (when making them or when returning to them) and shall be able to add a comment to a comment. Comments shall indicate who made the comment (which requires that users be named)
- Users shall be able to view all comments and users with editing permission shall be able to delete (or “resolve”) comments.
- The CaSS Editor should support a “suggest” mode in which users can make edits, but the edits are stored as comments and do not affect a framework or competency until they are accepted by a user with edit permission, as in Google Docs.
- Users shall be able to undo and revise their suggestions. Editors shall be able to see that a comment is a suggested edit and to accept or reject the suggestion.
- If a resource is associated with a competency, users shall be able to add comments about the resource. These are essentially metadata about the resource and shall be visible when viewing alignments between the competency and resources. They are subject to the same requirements as other types of comments. (Note: This feature can be used to describe how the resource relates to the competency and may be mapped to a field in the CaSS schema. The requirement is that these appear and behave like other comments, not that they be implemented in a particular way.)
- It is possible that comments and piled-on comments get long. The interface shall not allow comments to dominate a view and may have views where comments are collapsed, partially collapsed, etc. to provide a usable experience.
- If the configuration supports an approval workflow, the CaSS Editor shall enable frameworks to have and display the status “approved.” If the configuration supports a publishing workflow, the CaSS Editor shall enable frameworks to have and display the status “published.”
- The CaSS Editor shall provide users with the ability to ask specific users to review, approve, or publish a framework if such action is supported by the configuration. The CaSS Editor shall issue such requests via email.
- If the configuration supports a review workflow, the CaSS Editor shall provide users with the option to request that a framework be reviewed. If a user makes such a request (and is authorized to do so), the CaSS Editor shall notify reviewers in accordance with the configuration.
- If the configuration supports an approval workflow, the CaSS Editor shall provide users with the option to request that a framework be approved. If a user makes such a request (and is authorized to do so), the CaSS Editor shall notify approval in accordance with the configuration.
- If the configuration supports an approval workflow, the CaSS Editor shall authorized provide users with the option to approve a framework. Approval shall change the status to “approved.”
- If the configuration supports a publication workflow, the CaSS Editor shall provide users with the option to request that a framework be published. If a user makes such a request (and is authorized to do so), the CaSS Editor shall notify the appropriate users in accordance with the configuration.
- If the configuration supports a publication workflow, the CaSS Editor shall provide authorized users with the option and ability to publish a framework in accordance with the configuration. The CaSS Editor shall provide an interface for the user to designate the parameters needed for publication. The CaSS Editor shall change the status of a framework to “published” after it has been published and the CaSS Editor has received acknowledgement that the publication operation succeeded.
- If review is supported in the configuration, the CaSS Editor shall enable users to request that a framework be reviewed if review is supported in the configuration.
- The CaSS Editor shall enable an open framework to be exported in the formats defined in the configuration. This export function shall be readily available from an open framework.
- Supported formats shall include CTDL-ASN, CASE, and a spreadsheet format (documented in CaSS).
- Supported formats shall include an AETC Format (if there is one.) In general, any format used by an organization for which a configuration is defined, and identified as important for that organization, shall be supported.
- Supported formats may include CEDS, PESC, ASN (non-CTDL), and MedBiquitous
- The CaSS Editor shall enable a user to mash up frameworks. The associated interface shall enable users to define the search for frameworks, search for and select competencies in any framework in the results list, and add those competencies as copies or as links to an open framework or to a newly formed framework.
- The CaSS Editor shall enable users to import frameworks from sources identified in the configuration if the frameworks are in a supported format.
