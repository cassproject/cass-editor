<h1>Practical Couch DB Training</h1>
<p>Description</p>
<p>NoSQL databases have become mainstream with their suitability to internet-grade applications. This course has been authored to leverage your knowledge of relational databases to leap into NoSQL concepts using CouchDB. We assume no knowledge of NoSQL databases and take you to intermediate level in this course. You will learn the constructs within CouchDB and become familiar with Map-Reduce language using JavaScript. This open source
technology ideally augments your project requirements. We will conclude this course with practical applications of CouchDB in JavaScript and .NET applications.</p>
