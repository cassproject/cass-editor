<h1>Teamwork Workshop - Teamwork in a Modern Workforce</h1>
<p>Description</p>
<p>Teamwork is the collaborative effort of a team to achieve a common goal or to complete a task in the most effective and efficient way.</p>
<p>This concept is seen within the greater framework of a team, which is a group of interdependent individuals who work together towards a common goal.</p>
<p>Basic requirements for effective teamwork are an adequate team size (about 6-8 members), available resources for the team to make use of (i.e. meeting space and time, guidance from a supervisor, support from the organization, etc.), and clearly defined roles within the team in order for everyone to have a clear purpose.</p>
<p>Teamwork is present in any context where a group of people are working together to achieve a common goal. These contexts include an industrial organization (formal work teams), athletics (sports teams), a school (classmates working on a project), and the healthcare system (operating room teams). In each of these settings, the level of teamwork and interdependence can vary from low (e.g. golf, track and field), to intermediate (e.g. baseball, football), to high (e.g. basketball, soccer), depending on the amount of communication, interaction, and collaboration present between team members.</p>
