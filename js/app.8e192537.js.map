The first (required) CSV describes the competencies to include in a new framework. The second (optional) CSV describes the relations between the competencies found in the first framework.\n                    Each row in the first CSV will represent one competency, and each row in the second CSV will represent one relation between two competencies. The relations can be between competencies found in the first CSV, competencies found in other frameworks, or a mixture of the two.\n                    You can select the columns to use to describe the id, name, description, and other fields.\n                </p>\n                <div class=\"buttons is-right\">\n                    <a\n                        :href=\"csvExampleCompetenciesFile\"\n                        target=\"_blank\"\n                        download=\"CAP Software Engineering - Competencies.csv\"\n                        class=\"button is-small is-outlined is-primary\">\n                        <span\n                            title=\"\"\n                            class=\"icon\">\n                            <i class=\"fa fa-download\" />\n                        </span>\n                        <span>Competencies Example</span>\n                    </a>\n                    <a\n                        :href=\"csvTemplateCompetenciesFile\"\n                        target=\"_blank\"\n                        download=\"Template - Competencies.csv\"\n                        class=\"button is-small is-outlined is-primary\">\n                        <span\n                            title=\"\"\n                            class=\"icon\">\n                            <i class=\"fa fa-download\" />\n                        </span>\n                        <span>Competencies Template</span>\n                    </a>\n                    <a\n                        :href=\"csvExampleRelationsFile\"\n                        target=\"_blank\"\n                        download=\"CAP Software Engineering - Relations.csv\"\n                        class=\"button is-small is-outlined is-primary\">\n                        <span\n                            title=\"\"\n                            class=\"icon\">\n                            <i class=\"fa fa-download\" />\n                        </span>\n                        <span>Relations Example</span>\n                    </a>\n                    <a\n                        :href=\"csvTemplateRelationsFile\"\n                        target=\"_blank\"\n                        download=\"Template - Relations.csv\"\n                        class=\"button is-small is-outlined is-primary\">\n                        <span\n                            title=\"\"\n                            class=\"icon\">\n                            <i class=\"fa fa-download\" />\n                        </span>\n                        <span>Relations Template</span>\n                    </a>\n                </div>\n                <h5 class=\"header is-size-4 has-text-weight-bold\">\n                    CTDL-ASN Formatted\n                </h5>\n                <p>\n                    For this import, you use one CSV.
